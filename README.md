RHVoice is HMM based synthesizer, which uses "formula" derived
from studying collected data. This process is called "the training
process". Here you can find data used to train different voices.

These datasets were taken from http://tiflo.info/rhvoice/ site:
 
 * russian/elena
 * russian/irina
 * esperanto/spomenka

"compiled" voices can be downloaded from
